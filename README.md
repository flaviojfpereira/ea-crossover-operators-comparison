Implementation of two versions of a standard evolutionary algorithm: one for each crossover operator mentioned. For each version of this algorithm, and each optimization benchmark problem, 30 runs were made.

The two crossover operators were One Point Crossover and Arithmetical Crossover. To assess the difference between the use of each, a statistical analysis was performed using hypothesis tests.
